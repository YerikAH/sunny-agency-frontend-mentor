# Frontend Mentor | sunny-agency solution 
This is a solution to the Sunny agency landing page. The challenge is from [Front-end Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef)

## Developing
### What I learned
- Developing with stylish components didn't cause me much trouble, in fact, I had a lot of fun developing it. However, I came up with the idea to learn CSS shorthand properties and some properties I didn't know yet.
- About the development with React, I created a **"useWidth"** hook that receives a number as a parameter, its operation is simple, it returns the number that is the width of the screen, and a boolean value, for example, if the number of the screen is greater than the number we enter as a parameter, it will change the state to true. It helped me a lot to change the images from mobile to desktop (towards a conditional rendering based on the boolean value).
- I also started to understand the state in React a little more, and to investigate other hooks, Apart from that, I got a little curious to study web accessibility, So possibly the next challenges will be a little more accessible.
